a simple game contract on WAX blockchain

Many blockchain games (on WAX) spend months (or in some cases 1 full year and still counting) in the "development" phase. Claiming that smart contract development is an extremely complicated process.

This repo/game is an experiment to prove that smart contract game development (on WAX blockchain) does **NOT** have to take months or even years. even by a developer (me - Benjie) with minimal unexperience in C++.

## Concept
This game (is / going to be) heavily inspired by [Sunflower Land](https://github.com/sunflower-farmers/sunflower-farmers) (formerly Sunflower Farmers), a pixel-art farming game on Polygon network, where players (farmers) can play to earn Sunflower Farmer Tokens.

## Features
* registration within the smart contract
* farm upgrading
* adaptive price/reward halvening based on supply
* farming (planting & harvesting)
* add/edit/remove fruit configurations

## Conclusion

This repo is a proof that smart contract development (on WAX blockchain) is not as difficult as many projects claim it to be.

Granted, this minimally working game example is very simple and cannot be compared to what some other games strive to do. But that is not an excuse for development taking several months given that this repo was done in just shy of 8 hours.
